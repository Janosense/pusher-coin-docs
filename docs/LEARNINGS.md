# Learnings — Pusher Coin

<!-- Harness defect log. Every time the agent did the wrong thing (overreach,
     misread instruction, ignored a rule, broken assumption) — it goes here,
     framed as a PROCESS defect, not a one-off annoyance. At sprint boundaries
     the user reviews this file and transfers fixes into the playbook repo
     (new playbook version). This is the improvement loop. At the retro every
     entry's "Transferred to playbook" is filled: a version, "local" (fixed in
     this project only) or "n/a" — "pending" survives only until the next
     retro. -->

Entry format:

## {{YYYY-MM-DD}} — [{{feature}}] {{What happened, one line}}
- **Incident:** {{what the agent did vs. what was expected}}
- **Root cause:** {{which instruction was missing, ambiguous, or overridable}}
- **Fix applied here:** {{change to this project's CLAUDE.md/commands/docs}}
- **Transferred to playbook:** {{version, or "pending"}}

## 2026-09-17 — [stripe] A real delta-audit does not fit FEATURE.md's 80-line guideline
- **Incident:** Step 1's delta-audit filled `docs/features/stripe/FEATURE.md` to 96 lines against the template's "Keep ≤80 lines" comment — the second time running: `realtime`'s own Step 1 audit left its FEATURE.md at 91 and logged the same overshoot as an open item. Both were compressed once and still did not fit.
- **Root cause:** The template sizes FEATURE.md for a feature summary, but `/plan-step` reads its "Shared code it depends on" as the authoritative touchpoint list, and `/do-step` §2 forbids trimming neighbouring sections to make room. A per-file, per-line audit of a feature that rewrites an existing payment path is simply longer than 80 lines, so the guideline loses to the instruction that needs the detail.
- **Fix applied here:** None — the audit detail was kept and the overshoot recorded, as `realtime` did. The durable fix is a playbook decision: either raise the guideline for features with a shared-code audit, or move the audit to its own file that FEATURE.md links.
- **Transferred to playbook:** pending

## 2026-09-15 — [core] `ddev start` silently rewrote a tracked config file
- **Incident:** During the wallet-rollback ad-hoc, `ddev start` regenerated `backend/wp-config-ddev.php` and dropped the hand-added `JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` defines. It showed up only as an unexpected `M` in `git status`; committing it would have broken local JWT login, and missing it would have left local login broken.
- **Root cause:** The file still carries DDEV's `#ddev-generated` header, so DDEV treats it as its own and overwrites it on start, while the project keeps hand-written constants in it. The root `CLAUDE.md` lists `ddev start` as a routine command with no warning.
- **Fix applied here:** The file was restored with `git checkout -- wp-config-ddev.php` and not committed. Check `git status` in `backend/` after every `ddev start` and restore that file if it changed. The structural fix — moving those constants out of the DDEV-owned file — is review item 6 in `docs/BACKEND-REVIEW.md`.
- **Transferred to playbook:** n/a — project-specific

## 2026-09-16 — [core] An ad-hoc off `main` had no check command to gate its commits
- **Incident:** The machine-power-switch ad-hoc branched from `main`, where `backend/bin/check` does not exist — it was created in `realtime` Sprint 1 Step 1 and only reaches `main` when that sprint merges. `/adhoc` §4 and `/do-step` §3 both require every commit to be gated by that one committed script, and equally forbid replacing it with an inline shell chain, so the ad-hoc could satisfy neither instruction as written.
- **Root cause:** The playbook assumes the check command exists on every branch work happens on. With chained sprint branches, tooling created inside a sprint is absent from `main` until the sprint boundary — and hotfixes are exactly the work that branches from `main`.
- **Fix applied here:** Gated with the exact committed script taken from the sprint branch (`git show realtime/sprint-1:bin/check`), run against the ad-hoc tree and removed again, rather than with a hand-written command chain. The durable fix is to land tooling like the check command on `main` directly instead of inside a sprint.
- **Transferred to playbook:** pending
